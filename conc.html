<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Although the various project goals and final project seemed very daunting for us at first, I believe we did a good job at completing all the requirements and ensuring effective functionality. Each person played a vital role in the creation of this app and throughout each sprint, we efficiently collaborated with each other to do work in a team environment. This process was not without any hurdles, however. There were many times specific teammates hit a roadblock in their portion of the sprint and such, but these issues were mitigated through the readiness of all other teammates to give assistance. I believe we learned a great deal from Android Studio, but more importantly how to utilize powerful tools such as Git and Github as well as how to coordinate a scrum environment. The knowledge gained about sprints and such will help ensure that each of us possess the requisite skills needed to be an effective member of a project team in the corporate world.</p>
